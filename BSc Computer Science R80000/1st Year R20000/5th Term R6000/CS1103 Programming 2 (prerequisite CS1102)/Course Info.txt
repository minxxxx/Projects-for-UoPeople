Learn Programming 2
Course Overview

This course builds on the Introduction to Programming 1 course and teaches a more highly developed Java programming language with features beyond the basic concepts covered in the first programming course. A large part of the course will be devoted to more advanced building blocks such as recursion, linked data structures, and Java’s Collection Framework. In addition to this, you will learn more about designing and coding complex, robust, and efficient programs. And you will be introduced to a professional programming tool: the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment.
