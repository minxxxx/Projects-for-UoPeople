>>> part2()
this is my nested list:
[0, 1, [2, 3], 4, 5]

this is the list inside my nested list at index 3:
[2, 3]

the * operator multiplies integers and repeats strings * n
2 x 2 = 4
HelloHello

using list slices to remove the first item from my nestedlist:
[1, [2, 3], 4, 5]

the += operator has 3 functions:
it can increment an integer and overwrite the value simultaneously
3
it can concatenate strings
hellothere
and it can append an item to a list
[0, 1, [2, 3], 4, 5, 'hello']

using a list comprehension filter to filter out hello from the list:
[0, 1, [2, 3], 4]

using the extend operator for a list but not using the [] will be legal but will result in this unexpected addition:
[0, 1, [2, 3], 4, 'g', 'o', 'l', 'd']
hence adding each character instead of the string as a whole to the list (also happends with append)
