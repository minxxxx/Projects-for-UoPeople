Learning Journal Unit 8
Reflection Topic: Learning Outcomes

Congratulations on reaching the last full week of UNIV 1001: Online Education Strategies.
Throughout the term, we have learned a lot together.
We have focused on effectively navigating UoPeople courses, understanding the process and impact of peer assessment, and examining and developing key learning skills such as critical thinking and self-directed learning.
We have also worked to understand and apply important strategies for reading, studying, APA citations and references, time management, stress management, and test management.

For your last journal entry, reflect on the different things you have learned over the term.
Then, in a 300-500 word journal entry (at least 300 words but no more than 500 words), answer the following:

What was the most useful strategy you learned during this course?
How will you apply this strategy in your future studies here at UoPeople?
What was the most surprising thing you learned this term?
Why did it surprise you?
Peer assessment is a unique education model.
Think back to how you felt about peer assessment at the beginning of the term, and compare that to your feelings now.
How have your feelings changed?
Are you more comfortable with peer assessment?
Have you learned something new while assessing your peer’s work?

APA Exercise:

We have also worked hard to develop our APA skills, so be sure to practice your APA citations and references by including at least two references and two in-text citations. These citations and references should be incorporated into your Reflection - they should not be a separate activity.

Note: If you are struggling, try reviewing the UoPeople APA tutorials in the LRC.
