Learning Journal Tasks
1. Learning Journal Reflective Comments:

Write short reflective comments or notes about your learning activities during the week. It is highly recommended that you make these entries on a daily basis. You will be assessed on the completeness of your Learning Journal, and the quality of your self-reflection.

You should date each entry, and use clear titles and sub-headings.  These entries should be brief, direct sentences indicating quick comments or notes such as:

* when you completed each step in the Learning Guide during the week,

* any problems or unexpected events that occurred during the week (including problems understanding new or old material), and

* any other noteworthy that might affect your performance in this class.

There is no need to include personal information or details of family events, but be sure to mention the existence of any situations that will positively or negatively affect your ability to focus on the classwork.

2. Vocabulary and R functions

a) What is a sampling distribution (include an APA citation)?   _________

b) What is the Law of Large Numbers?________

3) Describe in your own words (do not directly quote any source) the difference between the distribution of a sample and the sampling distribution.  Use an example in which the original population has a binomial distribution.  You will probably use concepts from the book or another source, so be sure to cite any concepts that come from such sources (even if you paraphrase).
