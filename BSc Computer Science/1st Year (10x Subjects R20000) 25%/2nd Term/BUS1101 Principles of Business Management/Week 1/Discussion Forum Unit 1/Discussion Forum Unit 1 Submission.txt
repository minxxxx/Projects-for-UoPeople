Hi fellow classmates, my name is Catherine. I am studying BSc Computer Science through UoPeople and have taken this course as an elective module for my degree. I have no managerial experience whatsoever, as I have no work experience whatsoever thus far. Being a millennial is difficult as I am ceratin most of you would agree. Laugh. I would love to learn the basics of leadership in this course as I find this would assist me greatly in my teamwork as a developer in my future job once I graduate.
