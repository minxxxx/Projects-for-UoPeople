As noted in this week’s textbook chapter, employees are happier when they received regular feedback (Carpenter, Bauer, & Erdogan, 2010, p.97). Feedback takes many forms, but one of the most obvious types is feedback on performance. Managers must be able to give employees feedback on what they are doing well, and areas where an employee needs to improve. Think about times in your career when you have received feedback, and write a response that includes the following:

Share an example of a time when you received effective feedback that helped you improve your performance. What made that feedback helpful? 

Share an example of a time when you received feedback that was not helpful. What made that feedback ineffective?

Using your two examples, what can you conclude about the characteristics of effective feedback? If you were a manager, how could you use these lessons to improve the feedback you gave?
