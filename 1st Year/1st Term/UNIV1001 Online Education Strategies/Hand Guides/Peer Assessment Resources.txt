Peer Assessment Resources:

While writing and discussion are how you demonstrate your learning, peer assessment is an important reflection of your learning. While many students first think of peer assessment as a necessary chore, the truth is that peer assessment is a learning activity that challenges you to apply critical thinking as you read and evaluate your peer’s assignment.

Peer assessment takes two main forms here at UoPeople. First, in discussions, you will rate and respond to at least three of your classmates’ discussion posts. Second, when you have a Written Assignment, you will peer assess three Written Assignments. The criteria to assess will always be provided; you just have to evaluate how well your peer met the criteria. While peer assessment doesn’t always involve conversation, it does involve a number of skills that will enhance your own learning. You’ll need to read carefully, and to assess, you’ll need to understand the concepts you’re assessing. The best way to understand something is to teach it - when peer assessing, you will reach a deeper understanding of course concepts.
