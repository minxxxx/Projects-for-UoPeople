How I take notes:

Theory:
The way I take notes is a 3 steps process.

1) First I work through the materials (i.e. read through the entire theory hand guide) and while doing so I write down a rough summary of what I am reading, which helps me to absorb the information better and build a big picture of how everything fits together so that I can visualize the best way to summarize it, for example, should the theory text book be summarized by the different computers, or by the dates they were created on, or by the companies who created them as the main categorization I sort the information by and build my links from? These rough summaries I save in the Theory/Rough_Notes folder.

2) While doing this I pay special attention to certain terms whose meaning I do not understand, highlighting and researching them to draw up a flowchart with a technical terms summary using draw.io (an awesome downloaded application, which can be found at https://draw-io.en.download.it/downloading for Windows). This technical term summary I save as Techincal_Terms_Summary_Week_7.drawio in the Theory/Summary folder.

3) I then use draw.io to draw up a visual flowchart of how all the information is connected, summarized in whatever order seems most logical to me. This big picture summary (for easy digesting) of how all the condensed information is connected I save as Theory_Summary_Week_7.drawio in the Theory/Summary folder.

Practical:
I use draw.io to structure my program and to represent what each function does, how it enteracts with other functions and how my program flows so as to give a visual representation of how what I created works. Often trying to grasp the overall symmantics and finer details of the code simultaneously simply by reading the actual code source files can be difficult, especially with larger programs that contain multiple files and for less experienced coders or a less technically inclined audience such as managers (who may not have a firm grasp on coding itself but who will grasp a visual representation with simple english explanations much more easily). This technical term summary I save as Practical_Summary_Week_7.drawio in the Practical/Summary folder.

I also link everything to my Github account for cloud storage and to allow sharing of my hard work. :)
