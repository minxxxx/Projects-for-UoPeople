Learning Journal Unit 1

Part 1:

Exercise 1.1 from your textbook recommends that you try to make mistakes when experimenting with a new programming feature. 

This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also helps when you are programming because you get to know what the error messages mean. It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later and accidentally. (Downey, 2015, 7)

For this Learning Journal, first, answer the following questions based on Exercise 1.1. Include example Python code and output with your answers.

If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks or both and why?
You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens for each of the following and why?

>>> 2++2
>>> 2--2
>>> 2+-2
>>> 2-+2

In math notation, leading zeros are OK, as in 02. What happens if you try this in Python and why?
What happens if you have two values with no operator and a space in between them and why?

Part 2:

Next, describe at least three additional Python experiments that you tried while learning Chapter 1. Show the Python inputs and their outputs, and explain what you learned from the results of each example.
