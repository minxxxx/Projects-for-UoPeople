Learning Journal Unit 4

Reflection Topic: Critical thinking and peer assessment

Reflect and write at least 300 words (but not more than 500 words) on the following:

How does critical thinking relate to peer assessment?

What strategies from this week can you apply when you assess Written Assignments?

At this point, you have completed a practice assessment and an actual assessment of a Written Assignment. You have also rated posts each week on the Discussion Board. Has any part of the process surprised you?

Do you have any concerns about assessment?

APA Exercise:

Every week in your learning journal for Online Education Strategies, you will practice APA format. This week, you are going to learn how to cite an online video file like a TED talk or Youtube video. Use the internet to find a video about critical thinking, such as a TED talk or a Youtube video. Then, complete the following exercise:

What is the title of the video?

Who is the speaker (or who uploaded the video)?

What year was the video published?

What URL is the video available at?

Using the information from #1-4, write the APA reference for the video file you found. The reference goes at the end of your work, after all of your writing is finished.

Now, let’s write the in-text citation, to use at the end of a sentence you are writing. In-text citations are always (Author, Year). Using the information from #5, write the APA in-text citation for the video you found.

Note: If you are struggling, try reviewing the UoPeople APA tutorials in the LRC. A TED talk is cited like a Youtube video, with the speaker in place of the uploader.
