Discussion Forum Unit 5

You are required to submit a substantial response to the Discussion Assignment, which will be posted by your instructor in the Discussion Forum below. A substantial response is one that stays on topic and fully addresses the assignment in a clear, concise, and meaningful manner. If your instructor requires a specific word count, it will be stated in the assignment.

After you respond to the assignment, you are then required to both give a rating and also leave a significant comment (3-4 complete sentences) to at least three (3) of your peers' responses, in order to receive full credit. Rate only the substantial responses that contribute to the promotion of the discussion, and not the comments of your peers.

Please review and follow the guidelines below for assessing your peer's responses to the Discussion Assignment.

Discussion Forum Rating Guidelines:

10 (A) - Excellent, substantial, relevant, insightful, enriching, and stimulating contribution to the discussion. Also, uses external resources to support position where required and/or applicable.
8 - 9 (B) - Good, quite substantial and insightful, but missing minor details which would have otherwise characterized it as an excellent response.
6 - 7 (C) - Satisfactory insight and relevance, but required some more information and effort to have warranted a better rating.
4 - 5 (D) - Limited insight and relevance of the material; more effort and reflection needed to have warranted a satisfactory grading.
0 - 3 (F) - Unsatisfactory insight/relevance or failure to answer the question, reflecting a poor or limited understanding of the subject matter and/or the guidelines of the question.

If at any time you suspect that a post in this Discussion Forum violates UoPeople's rules regarding plagiarism and/or any aspect of UoPeople’s Academic Code of Conduct, please notify your instructor immediately.

Remember that your instructor will be reviewing responses, ratings, and comments - and will adjust ratings if he/she believes that they do not seem warranted or supportable.

Assignment:

This assignment is based on Exercise 8.4 from your textbook. Each of the following Python functions is supposed to check whether its argument has any lowercase letters.

For each function, describe what it actually does when called with a string argument. If it does not correctly check for lowercase letters, give an example argument that produces incorrect results, and describe why the result is incorrect.

# 1

def any_lowercase1(s):
     for c in s:
          if c.islower():
               return True
          else:
               return False


# 2

def any_lowercase2(s):
     for c in s:
          if 'c'.islower():
               return 'True'
          else:
               return 'False'


# 3

def any_lowercase3(s):
     for c in s:
          flag = c.islower()
     return flag


# 4

def any_lowercase4(s):
     flag = False
     for c in s:
          flag = flag or c.islower()
     return flag


# 5

def any_lowercase5(s):
     for c in s:
          if not c.islower():
               return False
     return True
