Compare the results of your personal time allocation to your ideal time allocation.
Are you close to your ideal allocation?
If not, what factors are affecting your use of time?
Based on what you’ve read this week, what strategies can you use to more effectively manage your time?
Be sure to identify at least three time management strategies, and describe how you will apply them.
Be sure that your Learning Journal entry is a minimum of 300 words (but not more than 500 words).

APA Exercise:

Every week in your learning journal for Online Education Strategies, you will practice APA format. For the first 4 weeks of this class, we have practiced how to cite and reference different kinds materials – books, articles, website, and videos. While there are other kinds of materials that can be cited and referenced, most will be very similar to what you have already learned, and so we are working on quoting and paraphrasing.

This week, we will continue working on how to correctly quote and how to correctly paraphrase. Go back to the video you found for our Week 4 APA exercise. Then, complete the following exercise:

What was the full reference for the video you found for the Week 4 APA exercise? (If your instructor gave you feedback on how to correct your reference, be sure to write the correct reference this week).
What was the in-text citation for the video you found for the Week 4 APA exercise? (If your instructor gave you feedback on how to correct your citation, be sure to write the correct citation this week).
If your video had a transcript, find a paragraph from the transcript, and copy and paste it here.
If it did not, do your best to include a full sentence directly from the video.
Select a section from #3, and using the APA rule for short quotations, put the section in quotation marks while adding an APA in-text citation at the end.
Re-read the section from #3, and re-write it in your own words while adding an APA in-text citation at the end. (This is called paraphrasing).

Note: If you are struggling, try reviewing the UoPeople APA tutorials in the LRC.
