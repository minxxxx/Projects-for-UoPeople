Introduce yourself in the Course Forum (located in the General Information area at the top of the course homepage)

Create a post introducing yourself to your classmates. In addition to your introduction, answer the following:

What skills and/or knowledge related to management do you have at this time?
What do you want to learn during the course?
Visit the Course Forum throughout the first week to respond to fellow classmates’ posts and respond to the answers to anyone who responds to your post.
