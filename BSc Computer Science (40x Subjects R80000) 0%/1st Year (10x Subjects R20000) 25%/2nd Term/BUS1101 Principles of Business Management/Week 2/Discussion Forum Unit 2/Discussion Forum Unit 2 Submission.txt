The personality trait I choose is neuroticism. To me this one is the most important out of all 5 as I tend to be very moody, and struggle with things like fears, anger, anxiety, etc. And if I can manage to move from being more sensitive and nervous on the scale of this personality trait to being more resilient and confident instead, I think many of these moddy feelings I have may dissipate. The moodiness affects my working life quite substantially and this is why I chose this personality trait from the big 5. One of my most important personal goals is achieving stability within a company team, integrating into the company culture and not letting my moods and my instability affect my standing in the company and in the relations I have with my teammmates. Stability is something I have always struggled with as well as being oversensitive. This trait aligns with my professional goal in the example that if I can be more resilient and confident, I can achieve my goal more easily.
