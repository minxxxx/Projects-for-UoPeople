Learn Computer Systems
Course Overview

This course is an introduction to computer systems. In this course we will begin by exploring the internal design and functionality of the most basic computer components. From there, we will use an online hardware simulator to actually “build” a computer and develop an assembler from the ground using concepts we will learn in the class. In the process, we will cover the ideas and techniques used in the design of modern computer hardware and discuss major trade-offs involved in system design as well as future trends in computer architecture and how those trends might affect tomorrow’s computers.
